### All said and done:
 - This feels quite bitter sweet. Along with SWE class being over, I also took the last exam of my undergraduate experience. Specifically in SWE, I can say that I truly enjoyed it. There are a few professors that I 100% recommend all students take at all expenses. That includes Mike Scott, Allison Norman and Glenn Downing. I'm sure that there are others of who I have simply missed the opportunity, but from my experience these three are a must. As a caveat, this recommendation comes based on the experience and knowledge that you'll gain from the class. Most certainly not an 'easy A' like I've heard some students request. 
 - This class in general is a great prep for the professional industry if you have not had any previous internships. I was a little disappointed at first because everything was in python but eventually we dove into software engineering, it's practices and implementations. There's a large group project which covers a majority of the semester. I couldn't recommend enough trying to take the class with some friends but also don't be afraid to meet new people. You never know if don't 'put yourself out there'.
